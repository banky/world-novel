        You are in command of British forces during the French and Indian War.
        After your forces suffer a sound defeat at the Battle of Fort Bull,
        rumors emerge among the British soldiers that the French are being led
        by a woman with magical powers. You write it off as an imaginary
        falsehood and continue strategizing with your fellow commanders until a
        mysterious stranger bursts into your tent, asserting to be a witch
        hunter. He tells you that the French have been bewitched by a woman who
        claims dominion over all of the New World. He offers to help you defeat
        this mystical warrior before she lays waste to the 13 British colonies
        and becomes Empress of the Americas.
